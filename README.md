# Standard RedwoodJS Starter

This starter provides a comprehensive RedwoodJS-based implementation that includes passkey authentication using WebAuthn, session management, database integration with Prisma, and file storage with Cloudflare R2. It serves as a fully integrated starting point for Redwood apps, consolidating various essential features into one package.

## Creating your project

```shell
npx degit redwoodjs/sdk/starters/standard my-project-name
cd my-project-name
pnpm install
```

## Running the dev server

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Point your browser to the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:2332/`). You should see a "Hello World" message in your browser.

## Deploying your app

### Wrangler Setup

Within your project's `wrangler.jsonc`:

- Replace the `__change_me__` placeholders with a name for your application

- Create a new D1 database:

```shell
npx wrangler d1 create my-project-db
```

Copy the database ID provided and paste it into your project's `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc
{
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "my-project-db",
      "database_id": "your-database-id",
    },
  ],
}
```

### Setting up WebAuthn Relying Party ID (`RP_ID`)

For production, set your domain as the `RP_ID` via Cloudflare secrets:

```shell
wrangler secret put RP_ID
```

When prompted, enter your production domain (e.g., `my-app.example.com`).

Note: The RP_ID must be a valid domain that matches your application's origin. For security reasons, WebAuthn will not work if these don't match.

### Setting up Session Secret Key

For production, generate a strong SECRET_KEY for signing session IDs. You can generate a secure random key using OpenSSL:

```shell
# Generate a 32-byte random key and encode it as base64
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Then set this key as a Cloudflare secret:

```shell
wrangler secret put SECRET_KEY
```

Never use the same secret key for development and production environments, and avoid committing your secret keys to version control.

### Setting up Cloudflare Turnstile (Bot Protection)

1. Visit [Cloudflare Turnstile Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile).

2. Create a new Turnstile widget:

   - Set **Widget Mode** to `invisible`
   - Add your application's hostname to **Allowed hostnames**, e.g., `my-project-name.example.com`.

3. Copy your **Site Key** into your application's `LoginPage.tsx`:

```tsx
// LoginPage.tsx
const TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY = "<YOUR_SITE_KEY>";
```

4. Set your **Turnstile Secret Key** via Cloudflare secrets for production:

```shell
wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
```

## Important Security Considerations

### Username vs Email

This starter intentionally uses usernames instead of emails. This decision prevents enumeration attacks and avoids requiring valid email addresses for registration.

### Authentication Flow

Authentication uses credential IDs from the authenticator instead of usernames or emails, significantly mitigating enumeration risks.

## Bot Protection

Registration is protected using [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/) to prevent automated bot registrations - while Cloudflare's built in bot detection will identify and block malicious patterns over time, Turnstile provides immediate verification before registration to prevent bot registrations from the start.
